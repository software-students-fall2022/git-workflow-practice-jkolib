# State of Software Engineering

I found this report produced by Hired.com to be interesting. The report can be found [here](https://hired.com/2022-state-of-software-engineers/).

This report compiled data taken from interactions between software engineers and companies done on Hired.com during the period from January 2020 to December 2021. Using this data, some interesting trends were noted, such as software engineers receiving more than double the average number of interview requests in 2021 than in 2020. It was interestig to see the important skills noted by Hired, which were Go, Ruby on Rails, and Scala, all which created about 1.8 times more interview requests for engineers with these skills. Additionally, the most in-demand software engineering roles were full-stack and backend engineers, where about 33% of interview requests in 2021 were for either of these positions. Finally, it was interesting to see what companies were doing to attract software engineers. Mid-market companies actually offered the highest salaries on average in 2021 at $158,241, compared to enterprise companies which only offered an average salary of $155,015 in 2021. From this article, there is much to be excited about in the field of software engineering, at least in terms of jobs prospects, which shows the importance and value that software engineers have.

It's interesting to see companies hire more people and begin to rethink how to use offices now that Covid forced many companies to do WFH. While obvious that the U.S has the highest salaries for software engineers, I wonder if that adjusts properly for cost of living. Remote roles seem to make this cost of living harder to calculate for however.
